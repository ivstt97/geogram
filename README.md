React Ionic Project 


Team Members - Iva & Razvan

To run the app in the browser the following commands are needed:

npm i
ionic serve - run in the browser
At the time, we have not managed to get the app to run on iOS.

On Android studio, the app should be able to open the android studio and simulate an android device following this command:

ionic cap open android Please note, Android Studio needs to be installed on the testing device for the command to work. An Android device is also required to be connected to the laptop/pc running Android studio for the simulation to work.
Permissions might be required for the camera to work. Those are in the 'AndroidManifest.xml' file, located under android/app/src/main/.
